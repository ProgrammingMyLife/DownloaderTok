# What is this exactly?

I initially made this tiktok video downloader so I can get to learn ruby and become more advanced in front end development. 

# Doesn't tiktok have a built in downloader?

Yes, but this one is enabled on all videos and has no watermark. If you try to download a video on tiktok most of the time the creator has downloads disabled, and even If they are enabled, the video you download has an annoying tiktok watermark.

# How do I run it?

You must have Python 3 and Ruby installed on your system. After that, open a terminal window in the directory of this repository and run 


*For windows users, and linux users with built in Python 3*
<b>
<br>
```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

*For linux users with built in Python 2, but have recenty installed python3*



`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Ruby Requirements

All packages for ruby are in `rubyreqs.txt` and you must install them manually with `gem install <package>`


## After dependancy installation

After you have installed all dependancies, simply run `python app.py` and head over to `https://0.0.0.0:5000`
